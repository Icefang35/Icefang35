## Making games is my passion!
#### Hello! I am Austen Gralheer, a game developer and graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Engineering with my Bachelors in Computer Science, and a minor in psychology. The kind of games I am most excited to work on include exploration of narrative, with immersive stories for to get lost in, branching story lines to explore, and multiple paths to discover. I have dreamed about making games since I was a child and that passion has only grown alongside my knowledge of the process.

I have multiple years of experience of with Roblox Studio, Unity, Unreal Engines 4 and 5, as well as experience leading teams of programmers, artists, and musicians. Most recently I worked at Funomena as a Gameplay Engineer, writing code for some of their Roblox Experiences. Before Funomena, I finished development on "Climate Commander", a NASA-mentored game focused on educating on the real-life issues and data related to climate change.

You can find examples of stuff I've worked on at [my website](https://austengralheer35.square.site/).
